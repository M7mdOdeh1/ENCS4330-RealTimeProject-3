# Simple Calculator Using PIC Assembly

## Project Overview
This project is a simple calculator designed to perform multiplication operations using two PIC16F877A microcontrollers. It demonstrates the integration of hardware and software components to create a functional computing device.

## Hardware Components
- 2 x PIC16F877A Microcontrollers
- 1 x Push Button
- 1 x 16x2 Character LCD

## System Behavior
- Initial display of a welcome message on the LCD.
- Input and calculation of two-digit integer multiplication.
- Display of the multiplication result on the LCD.

## Development Tools
- MPLAB IDE for assembly code development.
- Proteus for schematic design and simulation.

## Setup and Configuration
- Communication between the master CPU and co-processor through PortC.
- Use of PortB.0 for the push button and PortD for LCD connection.

## Code Implementation
- Assembly language used for programming the microcontrollers.
- Separate MPLAB projects for each microcontroller.

## Building and Testing
- Compilation of assembly code in MPLAB.
- Use of generated hex files in Proteus for simulation.

## Usage
- Start with inputting the first number, followed by the second number.
- Observe the multiplication result displayed on the LCD.
